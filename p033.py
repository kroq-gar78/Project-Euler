# Project Euler: problem 33
#
# The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
# mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe
# that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
#
# We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
#
# There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
# less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and
# denominator.
#
# If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common
# terms, find the value of the denominator.
